        <h3 align="middle">Overview</h3>
        <p>Through this project, I built a rudimentary rasterization method which can be
        adapted to use a variety of techniques, including bilinear and trilinear sampling
        and variable sampling rates to display textures and colors across polygons. Through
        this project, I learned a lot about different anti-aliasing techniques and mipmap
        methods to speed up rendering.</p>

      <div className="section">
          <p className="section-description">
              My approach to rasterizing triangles is to find the minimum
              and maximum of X and Y, then use that to create a bounding box
              around the triangle which is sampled to check if the center of each point is
              inside or outside of the triangle. The method used to check if the center
              of each point is inside the triangle is also taking care of the edge cases by only
              classifying points that lie on an edge as being inside the triangle if
              they lie on a "top edge" or a "left edge." Each point classified as
              being inside the triangle then has it's Color set to the Color specified.

                In order to implement supersampling, I added an additional
                set of for loops that run through the sample x and y of a point (up to the
                sqrt of the sample_rate).The sample_x and sample_y are used to calculate
                the coordinate of the sample in relation to the overall image. The sample
                coordinate is then tested to see if it is inside the triangle, and if so, it is
                sent to fill_color() to be included as 'colored' in the
                sub_pixel matrix.

              vertices of the triangle). The weights uniquely define the converted point and are themselves
              defined as being a ratio of the area of the triangle whose vertices are the converted point and the two vertices
              that the weight is not related to, over the area of the triangle defined by the three vertices.

              Colors can be blended across the 3 vertices using this same weighted average in relation to

              color an image, when the pixels of the texture are not 1:1 with the pixels of the

                Bilinear sampling takes an average of the colors of the closest 4 texture pixels to the image pixel coordinate.
                It assigns weights to each of the texture pixel colors as a ratio how close they are to the image pixel coordinate
                over the total distance between the texture pixels. This interpolation results in a more even color gradient, and
                smoother lines in areas that the nearest sampling method is more blocky. (This effect can be seen by comparing the images to the left.)
                This effect is especially noticable at lower sampling rates because at these lower
                sampling rates, there will be less subsamples to average across for nearest sample methods, while
                bilinear sampling has built in interpolation/averaging.

                Level Sampling<br/>
                Level sampling is adjusting the texture file used in certain areas to match the pixel
                texture footprint and approximate the correct result in order to reduce aliasing. A mipmap is
                constructed which contains the texture prefiltered at multiple resolutions, at each level
                containing a map which is 1/4 the size of the previous map. This mipmap takes up 4/3 of the original size in memory.
            </p>
            <p>
                Implementation<br/>
                The mipmap level is determined by analyzing the texture footprint of a
                pixel on a texture using one-pixel difference vectors du and dv. The texture footprint
                is based on how many texture pixels are included in an image pixel's space.
                Using a Nearest Level approach, the level that the color for the image pixel would be
                pulled from would be the Level which most closely matches a 1:1 pixel ratio. This approach
                results in one of the fastest rendering times, and a generally smoother image.
                My Trilinear approach takes the closest two levels and performs an interpolation of their
                bilinear sampled colors at the image pixel coordinate. This approach results in a smoother image
                and faster rendering time than a non level-sampled approach.

                I went through a diagram of what every object involved in the flip would look like before and after the flip.
                I grabbed all those objects and then reset their pointers to what they would be in the after stage of the diagram.
                I had an issue with it loading forever, but that cleared up after I reduced a few unessential pointer settings.

                I implemented this section in a similar method to how I handled the previous section on flips, working through a
                set of before and after diagrams. I realized after I finished implementing it and ran into some errors testing that
                I had assumed the half-edges were running clockwise instead of counter clockwise. I went back and redid the flip
                operation and then redid the split operation.

                The images on the left show an unaltered mesh (top), a mesh with splits (middle) and a mesh with both splits and flips (bottom).

                I implemented the Loop subdivision step by step.
              </p><ol>
                <li>I started by computing new positions for all the vertices in the input mesh, using the Loop subdivision rule. I also used this step to
                  mark each vertex as being a vertex of the original mesh.
                </li>
                <li>Computed the updated midpoint vertex positions associated with edges (again using the Loop subdivision rule, based on the current positions of the points), and
                  stored this value it in Edge::newPosition.
                </li>
                <li>Split every edge in the mesh that was not connected to a new vertex. I used this step to insert the newPosition held in the edge into its midpoint.
                </li>
                <li>Flipped any new edge that connected to an old and new vertex.
                </li>
                <li>Finally, copied all new vertex positions into the final Vertex::position.
                </li>
              </ol>
              Loop subdivision drastically softens sharp edges and corners. It is possible to slightly alleviate this effect
              by splitting the corners of the square multiple times.<br /><br />
              In the case of the square, due to the slant of the edges across the 6 faces, subdivision
              will result in an assymetric, albeit smoother object. By splitting each of the edges that go
              across the faces and balancing out this slant, it is possible to obtain a much more symmetrical subdivision.
