    <p>
      The goal of this research project when it began was to create an intuitive interface for controlling drones in Augmented Reality.
      I joined the controls team of the project during my sophomore year at UC Berkeley. Our project was selected as one of the
      Award Recipients for the first Microsoft Hololens Academic Research Grants. For a while our team didn't have access to the
      Hololens, so we worked on ways of controlling the drones using existing controller free systems like the Leap Motion or Mio.
      When we received the Hololens, we learned that the primary system of interaction was through a series of airtaps, not at all the fluid
      hand gestures and tracking we had hoped for. The headset's connection latency would also be far too great to allow for direct control
      of the drone. The project was off to a rough start.
    </p>
    <p>
      We needed information on how to create a useful platform for drone users. On the design team, I conducted a user research study in which I ran
      several interviews with members of the UAVs at Berkeley club. I used the data gathered to identify several areas in which an Augmented Reality
      interface would be useful for drone users, such as multi-drone flight and cinematography. Based on these applications and taking into account latency
      limitations, I designed a framework for the interface. This framework included a bounding box the the drone would be locked inside by GPS in case
      of connection loss, the ability to set camera angle and a path through nodes that could be moved through 3d space and angled similar to a BÃ©zier
      curve. We put this plan into motion and prototyped a Unity application over the next few months.

      After completing a Minimal Viable Product for the interface, the pressure came on for our SLAM (Simultaneous Location and Mapping) team, the group responsible
      for creating a method of mapping the terrain the drone and giving it a relative location to its environment. Several graduate students joined the project and we worked
      closely with them to test various approaches with a motion capture system. The current testing system uses a <a href="https://github.com/HJReachability/meta_fastrack/tree/vr2">Meta Planner</a>
      developed at Berkeley by David Fridovich-Keil, Sylvia Herbert, and Jaime F. Fisac, with several other contributing members. This controls system switches between different planning
      approaches based on the number of obstacles observed and automatically paths around even dynamically moving obstacles.

      As I approached my senior year, ISAACS splintered into several different research groups and I led one of these new directions for the project.
      I spearheaded the interface development for a grant the Center of Augmented Cogntion had received to create a <a href="https://github.com/j-paterson/ImmersiveDroneInterface">Virtual Reality interface for 3d mapping cities with drones</a>.
      In Spring 2017, I ran a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/14nl7Z2ZI2epftfA65nk6MDxMYHrNIRIy0gccS5OJ7I0/edit?usp=sharing">qualitative
      user research study</a> on the Hololens prototype with UAV pilots, and identified a number of UX improvements to be included in the VR interface.
      These improvements included both direct and over distance waypoint placement, visualization of the path with drone progress, the addition of
      intermediate waypoints, precise on the fly adjustment of the path, and adding lines down to the floor along with eventually adding a grid pattern
      to make the locations of the waypoints and current scale more clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new interface aimed to provide:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Good <b>visibility</b>, enabling the user to tell state of system and alternatives for action
        </li>
        <li>
          A clear <b>conceptual model</b>, with clear consistency in presentation of operations and results
        </li>
        <li>
          Good <b>mappings</b>, with an obvious relationship between controls and effects, and system states.
        </li>
        <li>
          Continuous <b>feedback</b> on the results of actions
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        I worked over the summer with an intern and created a prototype of my Virtual Reality interface design.

      I then took this interface and had people try it out it during Cal Day. One of the first things that I found was that the tutorial process really needed
      to be automated and experienced entirely in VR. After testing, I recruited and trained new several team members to help implement a series of design changes,
      <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IhvMWWXxOOTSPhDNx3lyz_GkY1E7i63yABNXlr-_cXY/edit">transitioning from 'Menus Galore' to the 'Click-Click' controls scheme</a>.
      We also developed tutorial using tooltips to visually link the verbal instructions to the controllers and their actions on the environment.
      This new interface reduced path creation and adjustment task time by 20%, reduced depth perception errors and was found by all users to be more intuitive.
      Upon completion of the interface, I built a Robotic Operating System API to stream data between Unity and the Motion Capture System that we use as a server for communication between the drone and a computer. This data is also used for predictive
      analytics, displaying the intended approach of the semi-autonomous obstacle avoidant controls system.

    <p>
      This interface was also built to be an open source platform for future research, with transparent code architecture and documentation to enable large scale collaboration.
      To facilitate open source use of the platform, I rearchitected the entire platform after we had implemented a majority of the final interactions in order to create a more efficient, intuitive and well documented code base.
      I am currently running a final round of user testing and will conclude with writing a UX Research paper comparing the immersive interface to more traditional interfaces and relaunching the isaacs.io website to provide a walkthrough of the open source material.
