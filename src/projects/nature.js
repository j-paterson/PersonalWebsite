      I worked on a number of design aspects of the College of Natural Resources flagship website, nature.berkeley.edu,
      along with many other departmental sites such as nst.berkeley.edu and https://nature.berkeley.edu/breakthroughs/
      during as a front-end developer for the CNR Web Team.

      Originally, my assignments consisted of moving and redesigning massive quantities of content and users
      from an older site to this one. I gradually learned the ins and outs of the drupal system and handled
      requests for content changes. A lot of running this website has been identifying what aspects can be
      automated to reduce work by hand. I learned to create modular pages that self populate with pieces of
      content from around the site to create comprehensive compilations that require no manual updating. I also
      learned to carefully run batch processes to adjust design on a large number of content items at once.
